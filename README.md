jgl - README
===

jgl is a JavaScript graphics library for running psychophysical experiments online.

jgl integrates with psiturk to have a quick an easy way to put your experiments on
Amazon Mechanical Turk(AMT). 

This is the documents page for jgl. Here you can find documentation on every function
available to you from both jgl libraries, jgllib as well as jglTask. In addition, 
there are tutorials available for your convenience. 

A note on generating this beautiful documentation: It was generated by a tool called
jsDoc. This tool can be downloaded for free. Then the following command was used:

./jsdoc -d ~/code/web/jgl/doc  ~/code/web/jgl/jgllib.js ~/code/web/jgl/task/ ~/code/web/jgl/README.md -u ~/code/web/jgl/tutorials

Note a few things, first my path to the jgl repo may be different than yours, secondly, 
this command must be done from within the jsDoc directory.
